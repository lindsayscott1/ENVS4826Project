# ENVS4826Project
*The code and files in this repository are in relation to the ENVS 4826 Final Project, completed by Lindsay Scott, Pavlos Skarvelis, and Madison Silver.*

The project looked at the change in agricultural methane emissions over time on a worldwide scale, as well as within Canada, and the Unites States.

All of the data used for this project in this repository came from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) at the following link: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#compare

The **ENVS4826ProjectScript** file is the R script used to complete our analysis and create the figures we used for our project paper

**FAOSTAT_data_12-2-2020.csv** is the main file for this project, and in the script was named as the object "faodata".

**FAOWorldData.csv** is one of the files used for the statistics portion of the project. It is an edited version of the original dataset, and is in the script file as the object named "worlddata".

**FAOCanadaData.csv** is another file we created by editing the original dataset for the use of running statistical analysis, and is in the script file as the object "canadadata".

**FAOUSData.csv** is another file we created by editing the original dataset for the use of running statistical analysis, and is in the script file as the object "usdata".
